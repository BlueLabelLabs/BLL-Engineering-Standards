## 1.0. **General**

All source code must live in a Git repository 
(either hosted on GitHub or Bitbucket, as per client requirement).

### 1.1 **Basic Code Quality Standards**

#### 1.1a. **All files must have properly spelled names in TitleCase**
All source code files must be spelled properly with proper grammar and must be TitleCased.
* "Contants.swift" - WRONG, it should be "Constants.swift"
* "LoginViewcontroller.swift" - WRONG, it should be "LoginViewController.swift"
* "Utill.swift" - WRONG, it should be "Util.swift"
* "appDefaultsManager.swift" - WRONG, it should be "AppDefaultsManager.swift"

Additionally, variable names should be self-explanatory.

This includes ALL files, not just source code files but XCode project files, workspace files or .NET solution/project files.

#### 1.1b **All source code files must NOT contain any copyright statements**
All source code files must have the copyright headers inserted by XCode removed and deleted. There should be NO comments at the top of the file having to do with copyright OR anything like "Created by MAC038 on 06/10/17"

## 2.0 Git Standards and Best Practices
All BlueLabel engineering team members must review and adhere to the revised guidelines contained within the [BlueLabel Git Standards document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQuFHxIo_o_UhAI-LsanvG9xHQ8LfFi_uKCh2s0_N3k/edit).
