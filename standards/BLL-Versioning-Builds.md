### 1. Sandbox & Production
Sandbox and production build numbers should always match.

### 2. Visibility
The version number and build number should always be visible in the app somewhere.

### 3. Admin Portals & Web Sites
Admin portals and web sites should also have version and build numbers associated with them.

### 4. Version Detection & Forced Update
All mobile app clients must implement logic to handle forced update messages passed to it from the server. The forced update mechanism is detailed in this document: http://bit.ly/BL206-Forced-Update
